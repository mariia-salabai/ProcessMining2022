Exercise 2
Print the next elements of array s: 10th, from 10 to 20, all elements more than 0

import numpy as np
s = np.random.normal(0,1,100)

# Your answer here
Exercise 3
Make a function pow that raised base number to a fixed power power. If power >= 50 print message "power is too big" and return -1

# Your answer here
Exercise 4
Make a function above(x,n) which returns all elements x > n. By default x = 10. Use numpy arrays

import numpy as np
# Your answer here
Exercise 5
Write a function my_ifelse(x, exp, n) which test array x with expression exp to number n. For instance, my_ifelse(x,'>=',10) returns all elements of array x which greater or equal 10. exp can be <, >, <=, >=, ==. If exp dont match these expression array x is retured

import numpy as np

Exercise 6
Make a function called counter that takes a string input_string and returns a dictionary of letter counts.

# Your answer here
Exercise 7
From the function counter make function counter_sorted with second boolean argumens reverse that returns sorted letter counts. Order depends of the reverse argument. By default reverse = False
